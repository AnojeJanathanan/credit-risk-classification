# credit-risk-classification

This module allows me to analyze and train a model according to loan risk. The main purpose is to build a ML model that can accurately identify the credit worthiness of borrowers using this particular dataset. Moreover, the objectives are to split the data into training/testing sets, create a Logistic Regression Model, then end off with a written report to summarize my findings.
